Project completed:
1.(a) Draw three 2D "elevations" ("front" is in left-top, "top" is in left-bottum, "side" is in right-top) (b) Enter coordinates: choose your model format(s)
2. Transform object: apply 3D (Translate/Rotate/Scale/SHear) transformations to the created object.
3. Viewing: view your created object from multiple views.(in 3d part)
4. Transform camera/viewer/light sources(s).
5. Generate different projections of the objects (refer to class discussions about different projections, see projection "tree" see figure).
6. Edit/Change perspective projection vanishing points (1, 2, 3).


Week1:
I draw three 2D elevations: Front, Side, and Top.

Week2:
I added transforms(Translate/Rotate/Scale/SHear) for each elevations.

Week3:
I added 3D rotate objection of my elevations.
And the button"Go to Camera/Light" can link to transform camera/viewer/light sources(s). 
 
Week4:
I added 1, 2, and 3 point(s) perspective.
And Isometric.
